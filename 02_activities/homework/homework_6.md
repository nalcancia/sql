**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

The articles and stories discussed during the last day of our SQL class have highlighted the importance of ethics in database and software design. In one article, we saw a database design so rigid that any deviant input was inconsiderately rejected by the system, ultimately impacting the lives of marginalized people. Another article traced the roots of neural networks, emphasizing that their development stems from the collective work of thousands, if not millions, of hours of manual effort. Finally, a personal story addressed the ethical complexities of how we handle information in our daily lives.

These stories have given me much to ponder. They’ve made me realize that the systems we work with are not just machines and computers, but machines and computers that interact with people—and if implemented haphazardly, they can have significant implications on those people. While I believe I have a good set of personal ethics, I had never actively considered them as part of the code I write or the activities I perform. Perhaps subconsciously, I’ve always assumed my work reflects my values. However, now that I’ve become more aware, I think I can be more proactive in incorporating ethics as a fundamental part of my work.

In addition to my personal values, I’ve been exposed to the ethical standards of the organization I work with—mainly through mandatory online business ethics training—and familiarized myself with general ethical frameworks like PIPEDA, HIPAA, and GDPR.

To further develop my ethical awareness, I could focus on broadening my knowledge, gaining exposure to different cultures and perspectives, and better understanding ethical considerations that may be unfamiliar to me. I could also place greater emphasis on collaboration. In a sense, I’m already doing this through daily scrum meetings and code reviews, where the ethical values of my peers combine to form a common output. Additionally, I could help raise awareness by sharing these articles or engaging in discussions that highlight any ethical concerns I notice.

Overall, while I’ve always strived to act ethically, there are steps I can take to improve and promote ethics in small but meaningful ways. Like the case of the article on neural networks, where small contributions collectively lead to significant progress, I hope these efforts will help create a more ethical society.
